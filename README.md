# AI_projects

> I've completed a number of deep learning and machine learning projects in this repository.
In the future, I'll be adding other projects as well. The majority of the data was gathered from Kaggle, TensorFlow datasets, and other places that offer free data. In order to create my models, I used the Google Colab environment. 

I have also created a one responsive disease classification web app using [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/).

## Built With

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook


## Getting Started

> git clone `https://github.com/Micky373/AI_projects`

> cd AI_projects

> `pip install -r requirements.txt`

> Since the data was big I didn't push it to [GitHub](https://github.com/Micky373) but you can find all the data that I used to train the models [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1S8X1Z9cRxKPHstDUdYaga1uOUUlhW9et?usp=sharing)

> cd `notebooks`

> Here in the notebooks folder there are multiple machine learning and deep learning projects

> I have created one multiple disease classification streamlit web app you can check it out by running `streamlit run multiple_disease_prediction.py`

> Each machine learning and deep learning models are located in the `models` folder
